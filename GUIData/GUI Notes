GUI is gonna work like this:
Every GUI menu has an associated ID, and that ID stores data like GUI elements.

GUI Elements:
Button - Sets a variable/changes a list/broadcasts a signal when pressed. Can be conditional.
Switch - Has a "state", and sets the data to its state. Clicking it changes it's state. Can be conditional.
Text - Stores text and text settings and loads it.
Image - Displays an Image
If-Else Button? - Finds a condition and activates depending on that variable. Example: If i = 1, then set var to 5, if i = 2 then set var to 10.

All GUI elements can also have a prerequisite.

ok i did it, i made it display only active gui elements dont ask me how i did i just did it i was tired. i still am
either way now we need to make prerequisites.
prereqs require you to check each active gui and set it to inactive if its prerequisites are met
prerequisites then require you to check each inactive gui (which we now know how to do) and set it to active if it's prerequisites are met.

VAR/LIST
EQUALS/ABOVE
AMOUNT

works

GUI Elements:
right now we need to plan what the GUI elements are going to be and what properties they will take on.
Is there any situation where a conditional button will be necessary that can't just be prerequisites?
