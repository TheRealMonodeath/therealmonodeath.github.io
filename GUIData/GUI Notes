GUI is gonna work like this:
Every GUI menu has an associated ID, and that ID stores data like GUI elements.

GUI Elements:
Button - Sets a variable/changes a list/broadcasts a signal when pressed. Can be conditional.
Switch - Has a "state", and sets the data to its state. Clicking it changes it's state. Can be conditional.
Text - Stores text and text settings and loads it.

All GUI elements can also have a prerequisite.



Check inactive button and see if it's active
If it is, then set the GUIID to it's ID and create a clone
