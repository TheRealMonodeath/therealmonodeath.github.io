After an elite-grade BIO-SUIT is taken over by a mysterious, eldritch anomaly, 
it releases a form of Bio-Energy never before seen... a bio-energy that is fuels itself by destroying Bio-Energy, 
that quickly spreads across the earth, turning 99% of humanity into mindless zombies. 
The survivors must fight their way to the core of the apocalypse to destroy it, without dying on the way.

The protagonist, Sergeant Dave Zachary Shooter finds himself in a laboratory, waking up from an experiment known as BEST (Bio-Energy Stabilization Testing) as the only survivor (well, besides Jeffrey.).
